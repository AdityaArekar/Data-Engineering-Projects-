Hello!

This is an ETL project using Python. 

Libraries used: Pandas, datetime, glob, xml.etree


This project involves 3 steps. 

1) Extracting data from the source files.

2) Transforming data as per the requirement.

3) Loading the transformed data in a file.

Also we are creating a log file. 
Log file is essential for several reasons like Error Tracking, Audit trail, performance monitoring, Data Quality Assurance, Process Verification, etc.
 

Data source files are included in the "datasource.zip" file. 

Data is to be extracted from different filetypes like JSON, XML, CSV.


Python functions are used to extract data from each filetype.
